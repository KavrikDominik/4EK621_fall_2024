#### Aims of the course:
The aim of the course is to master the fundamental regression modelling techniques needed to evaluate typical research hypotheses in quantitative empirical research. Emphasis is put on specifying a suitable regression model, estimating it using a professional statistical package, and subsequently interpreting and verifying the results.
 
#### Learning outcomes and competences:
Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to design, estimate and interpret both linear and non-linear regression models and apply the results in a quantitative analysis.
